## Overview

### Data

```java
a carrier of information ,
is a symbolic representation of ovjective recognized , stroed and process by computers . 
including numerical data , integers , real numbers and so on . Non-numberical data , text , graphics , images , sounds ,etc.
```



### Data Element

```JAVA
A basic unit of data , usually considered and processed as a unit in a computer program .
```

### Data Item

```
the smallest unit that constitutes an indivisible data element
```

### Data Object

```
### Is a collection of data elements of the same nature , is a subset of data
```

### Data Structure

```java
      WHAT IS DATA STRUCTURE ? 
Data elements do not exist in isolation ; they are related.
A collection of data elments that have one or more specific relatioships with each other.
        What does it cover?
1, the logical relationships between data elements are also logical structuers.
2, the representation of data elements and their relationships in computer memory(also called image) is called the physical structure of data or the storage structure of data . 
3 , the operations and implementation of data , that is , the operations that can be imposed on data elements and the implementation of these operaions on the corresponding storage structure . 
/*
        two levels of data structure :
======================================================================================
 logical structure :
 Describes the logical relationships betweent data elements . 
Independent of the storage of data , independent of the computer
A mathematical model abstracted from a concrete problem 
======================================================================================
physical structure : 
the structure (storage mode ) of data elements and their relationships in computer memory . 
a representation of a data structure in a computer . 
*/
    //	Relationships between logical structure and storage structure : 
    1, A storage structure is an image of the logical relationship versus the element itself.
    2, Logical structure is the abstractio of data structure and storage structure is the realization of data structure . 
    
```

### classification of logical structures

```java
Linear structure :
//linear tables, stacks, queues, strings
NonLinear structure:
//tree , graph.
```

```java
set structure , linear structure , tree structure , ,graph structurte
```
