## Rate

- Data transfer rate or bit rate
- The rate at which hosts connected to a computer network transmit bits of data over digital channels 
- 连接在计算机网络上的主机在数字信道上传送数据位数的速率

### Bit

 0 / 1 

the unit is b/s, kb/s, Mb/s ,Gb/s ,Tb/s

千，兆，吉，太， 1000.  1kb/s = 1000 b/s

#### Memory capacity

  1Byte = 8 bit

1KB =1024B = 1024 * b

## Bandwidth

<font color='red'>**Maximum speed supported by the network device **</font>

Bandwidth used to refer to the frequency band width of a signal, the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies, in Hertz. 

带宽原来指某个信号具有的频带宽度，即最高和最低频率之差，单位是赫兹。

In a computer network. Bandwidth is used to indicate the ability of a network's communication lines to transmit data. You can also call it the highest data rate. 

计算机网络中。带宽用来表示网络的通信线路传送数据的能力。也可以称为“最高数据率”

##Throughput

- The amount of data passing through a network (channel, interface) per unit of time

单位时间内通过某个网络（信道，接口）的数据量

- Throughput is limited by network bandwidth or network rated rate
